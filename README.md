# mycode (Project One)

To show off my GREAT skills

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them. For now, maybe copy in how to install python and python3 using apt.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

The first few steps verify the Python 2.x and 3.x installations on your remote desktops. The closing steps are informational, and we encourage you to try installing Python 2.x and/or 3.x in your local environment (provided you have permissions).
```
Python 2.7 and 3.5 is installed on Ubuntu 16.04 by default. Letâ€™s verify that Python 2 and 3 are installed. Start by opening a command prompt.
```



```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo





## Deployment

Here we might put additional notes about how to deploy on various systems. For now, put a note that we're testing our code on Linux Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. 

## Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - The coding language used

## Contributing

Here you could make notes about how others might contribute to your code. For right now, a friendly message saying you'll accept any and all help from other coders would be great!
